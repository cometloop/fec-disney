## Notes

This is not a PROD ready app this is just for the assesment.

- I commited an .env file for the sake of this demo to show I would use env vars for things like the api base url here.

- I did something quick for responsiveness to get it look decent. If the figma provided had more direction here I would have tried to follow that.

- I did not do anything with pagination for search results

- I added a single generic toast message for any api errors. In PROD we would probably have various message for diff status codes, responses, etc
